On thursday, 19th December 2024, the dangote refinery announced the reduction in the price of its petroleum product PMS. The news warmed   the hearts of many Nigerians who had been facing rather challenging times due to the cost of the petroleum product.
Between January and November of the year, the price of the premium motor spirit had been increasing rapidly. This had a spiral effect on the cost of virtually every aspect of the Nigerian economy.
When the dangote refinery announced the reduction in price from 990 to 899 per litre, the news was well met with cheers.
President of the Independent Petroleum Marketers Association of Nigeria in response to the price reduction has said that its members are pleased with the development as it will benefit the Nigerian people.
